title: UbiTok.io permanently shutting down
subtitle: Goodbye and thanks for all your support!

Unfortunately, while technically impressive, UbiTok.io's totally decentralized exchange technology has not proven commercially successful.

In particular, paying Ethereum gas costs for each order placed or cancelled is unattractive to market makers - and without market makers, it's hard to attract customers.

Therefore the ubitok.io exchange web UI and website will be *permanently shutdown on July 15 2018*.

We *strongly recommend you withdraw any funds* (and cancel any orders) you have before then.

(Being unstoppable, the exchange smart contracts will continue to function as long as the Ethereum network is willing to execute them - but it's hard to interact with them without the UI!)

Thank you to all our customers and token creators for your support.
