title: Listing new Tokens on UbiTok.io
---

We're happy to list most tokens on UbiTok.io, here's what we look for before adding a token:

### Must Haves

- token contract has verified source code;
- token contract appears to implements the ERC20 interface correctly;
- token doesn't seem to be a scam;

### Nice to Haves

- token listed on coinmarketcap.com;
- a reputation of "Neutral" or better for the token on etherscan.io;
- listed on other exchange(s);
- token has some trading volume.

### Low volume Tokens

We're happy to list well-known, high-volume tokens straight away for our clients.

The cost for us at UbiTok.io of adding a token involves:
 - approx 0.05 ETH (~ $15 USD) in gas costs to create a book contract;
 - similar gas costs again when/if the book contract needs upgrading;
 - an hour or so of our time to check the token's reputation and ERC20 implementation.

It's not clear for less well-known tokens with little trading volume whether the fees we'd get from clients trading the token on UbiTok.io would ever cover these costs.

So from organizations requesting their own currently little-known token to be listed, we would appreciate one or more of:
 - a small donation of ETH or your token to our address 0x884378D7919125BDfd337145d871a1bA2a58c0E9;
 - a link back to UbiTok.io from your website (we have some logos in our [UbiTok.io Branding and Press Kit](../../img/ubitok-branding-press-kit.zip));
 - some sort of announcement to your followers / subscribers ("ACME Token now listed on UbiTok.io, the unstoppable Ethereum exchange ...") - on twitter we're [@ubitok_io](https://twitter.com/ubitok_io).

### Contact Us

To get a token listed, send an email to help@ubitok.io or raise an issue in [our github repo](https://github.com/bonnag/ubitok.io). Make sure you let us know the Ethereum address of the token you want listed!
