title: Tutorial - Depositing Ether and Buying Tokens using MetaMask
---

In this tutorial, we're going to deposit Ether into UbiTok.io and use it to buy OMG tokens.

This version of the tutorial assumes you've installed and are using the [MetaMask Chrome Extension](https://metamask.io/).

If you don't want to (or can't) use MetaMask, we have another [version for MyEtherWallet uers](../depositing-ether-and-buying-tokens-using-myetherwallet).

### Choosing MetaMask

First, make sure you've unlocked your MetaMask account by entering your password and selected the address you want to use with UbiTok.io.

The address will need enough Ether for your deposit, plus a little extra (say 0.05 ETH) to cover gas fees.

Go to the UbiTok.io pair you want to buy - in our case [OMG-ETH](http://ubitok.io/exchange/?pairId=OMG-ETH) - and when asked "How should UbiTok.io send Ethereum transactions?", choose MetaMask.

You might need to reload the UbiTok.io web page after unlocking your MetaMask account - sometimes it doesn't detect it straight away.

Here's a little video showing what to do:
