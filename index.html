<p>The KIWI exchange platform runs entirely on the blockchain, which means:
<ul>
  <li>no limits, no sign-up, no waiting for support to verify you;</li>
  <li>it cannot be shutdown - not even by its creators;</li>
  <li>you don’t need to trust anyone to look after your coins.</li>
</ul>
We also offer low fees and a rich trading experience.
</p>

<p>
  KIWI exchange aims to be the leading platform for trading KIWI along with other Ethereum assets on-chain,
  and to help grow an ecosystem of smart contracts trading with each other (and with you).

<p>
  KIWI Exchange will be live soon with our <a href="https://exchange.thekiwi.io/products/">first products</a>
  <!-- - start trading tokens such as
  <a href="https://ubitok.io/exchange/?pairId=OMG-ETH">OmiseGo</a>
  and <a href="https://ubitok.io/exchange/?pairId=SALT-ETH">SALT</a> !

<p>
  If you don't have an Ethereum account, you could try out our
  <a href="https://exchange.thekiwi.io/exchange/?pairId=DEMO-ETH">Demo Exchange</a> -
  it's a simulation running in your browser.
  To make it more exciting, there's some simulated trading bots too - can you beat them?
</p>

<p>
  We also have some Screencasts in <a href="http://ubitok.io/help/depositing-ether-and-buying-tokens-using-metamask/">our tutorial</a>,
  as well as a
  <a href="https://ubitok.io/exchange/?pairId=TESTR-ETH">"play-money" book on the "Ropsten" Ethereum Testnet</a>,
  and also on the (faster) <a href="https://ubitok.io/exchange/?pairId=TESTI-ETH">"Rinkeby" Ethereum Testnet</a>.

<h2 id="what-can-i-trade-on-ubitokio">What can I trade on KIWI Exchange?</h2>
<p>Coins/tokens based on Ethereum (such as ERC20 tokens) can be traded,
   either against Ethereum or against other tokens. <!--See <a href="products/">our list of products</a>.--></p>


<p>Examples of tokens we think are interesting include:
    <a href="https://augur.net/">REP (Augur)</a> (prediction markets),
    <a href="https://0xproject.com/">0x</a> (trading),
    <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">BAT</a> (advertising),

<h2 id="how-does-ubitokio-compare-to-other-decentralized-exchanges">How does KIWI Exchange compare to other decentralized exchanges?</h2>

<p>
  When we looked around, we found that other decentralized exchanges tended to compromise.
  Often they use an off-chain matching engine (meaning they are still vulnerable to downtime and hacking),
  and often they offer a much poorer trading experience than a traditional exchange.
</p>

<p>We were determined to offer a full limit order book with automatic best execution running entirely on-chain -
   and thanks to our unique order book representation we succeeded,
   meeting our five goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no off-chain matching engine so no servers to shut down or be hacked;</li>
  <li>a <a href="trading-rules">full limit order book</a>, giving clients the best possible price and the trading features you expect;</li>
  <li>clients don’t need to install any special P2P software;</li>
  <li>low fees (none for makers, 0.2% for takers);</li>
  <li>open platform - rather than just being an exchange we want to grow an ecosystem of smart contracts trading with each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whos-behind-ubitokio">Who’s behind KIWI Exchange?</h2>
<p>In one sense, no-one is - the exchange runs entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, and the open source web UI is statically hosted on github (pending move to Swarm).</p>

<p>KIWI Exchange is being developed by <a href="https://liberation.online">Liberation Online</a>.

<p>
  It is a fork of the amazing work done by Kieran Elby, a technologist with a background in algorithmic trading systems.
  He previously spent over a decade building secure, high volume gambling sites for leading bookmakers. He first dabbled in
  bitcoin in 2013 before flipping to Ethereum in 2015.

<h2 id="are-there-downsides-to-being-100-on-chain" style="clear: both">Are there downsides to being 100% on-chain?</h2>
<p>Yes - transaction times are much slower than a centralised exchange. This is hard to avoid - 1000s of Ethereum nodes worldwide need to agree on the state of the orderbook (without trusting each other). You won’t find High Frequency Traders on KIWI Exchange - not necessarily a bad thing for everyone else! We’ve also had to reduce the number of price levels offered to allow us to perform best execution on-chain - so you’ll see prices like 1.23, not 1.2298502.</p>

<h2 id="ok-but-how-do-i-withdraw-cash-from-ubitokio">OK, but how do I withdraw cash from KIWI Exchange?</h2>
<p>KIWI Exchange does not interface with the traditional banking system, so if you need cash in your bank account, you’ll need to use a third-party to turn your Ethereum or Ethereum tokens into cash.</p>

<p>Over time, we’re confident that withdrawing to a bank account will become less necessary for many clients as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>more coins and tokens are built on top of Ethereum, so transactions stay on-chain;</li>
  <li>more merchants accept payments in Ethereum or Ethereum-based tokens;</li>
  <li>more companies offer stable Ethereum tokens backed by fiat currency.</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, we're hoping ERC20 tokens backed by Bitcoin and USD (and other currencies) will become popular - KIWI Exchange will then be able to offer fiat pairs. Do we dare consider making a NZ Dollar backed token? ;)</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-fees-how-do-ubitokio-make-money">What are your fees? How does KIWI Exchange make money?</h2>
<p>Because we’re not dealing with banks, or user sign-ups, or hosting providers, we have much lower costs than traditional exchanges.</p>

<p>We guarantee to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>never charge any fees for depositing or withdrawing Ethereum, or Ethereum-based tokens;</li>
  <li>never charge any trading fees for orders that add liquidity to the exchange (that is, orders that rest on the book);</li>
  <li>never charge a trading fee of more than 0.2% for orders that take liquidity from the exchange (that is, orders that match against an order on the book)</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to avoid relying on trading fees, we hope to offer value-added products and services that build on top of our core exchange - see roadmap below.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have some ideas for smart tokens that can be traded on our exchange, or for autonomous smart contracts that place orders into the exchange - we look forward to seeing what can be done with a fully on-chain trading venue.</p>
